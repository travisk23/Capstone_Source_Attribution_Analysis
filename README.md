# Capstone_Source_Attribution_Analysis
Capstone project for Indiana University that provides correlation analysis of source attribution errors. 2021

The data for this study was obtained from the following site https://osf.io/tnymk/

The PDF that is included in this project gives an indepth look at the analysis I worked on. The analysis itself can be found in the accomanying .py file also within this repository.

# Conclusions Drawn from The Analyses
Analyses revealed a negative correaltion between the error rate and confidence data. We see that as confidence increases error rate decreases. This implies that particpants that are more confident in their choice of source attribution are more accurate in their source recall capablilites. We can determine through this analysis that particpants were most accurate when recalling a source as being a physical object. We also see that particants are almost as confident when determing a source was from a computor mionitor. The interesting bit of data shows that particpants displayed a wider range of confidence ratings, as well as having the lowest average confidenc rating for decing that the source stimulus was from a virtual reality envrionmnet. This supports the claims of the efficacy of virtual reality in future experimental use that has potetnial to become indistinguishable, in a particpant's memory, from reality. 

#What I have learned

During this process I have learned of the wider applications of virtual reality technology. More importantly, this has been my first attempt at processing data of any kind. From this project, I was able to learn about Pandas dataframes and their usefulness in data wrangling. The data I worked with had to be called from .csv files and required a fair amount of cleaning before it could be properly analyzed. I was able to interact, alter, and project data in ways that wer not only novel but useful to me. Using correlation data and scatter plots alongside box and whisker plots were not only an exciting foray into what I could do with this data, but it made me more confident in my ability to handle data analyses for future work. Looking back this project was straightforward with clear direction, I can only see that now because I have learned what it takes to get to this point.
